## Installation

This is a PHP/MySQL web application that you run from a browser. You can install it either locally
on your own PC, or to a web/intranet server.

### 1. Trying it out using Gitpod (requires a github account)

This application is ready to run within the Gitpod IDE.
This will allow you to try the application out and develop it for your needs.
All you will need is a web browser. _Do not use this in production!!!_

**[Launch private demo on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-inventory-manager)**

The app would take a couple of minutes to launch.
Afterwards, you'll see the welcome screen of the app in the right part of the window, where you can start the setup wizard.
When prompted to enter the database name, database username and datatbase password, you should enter `appgini` for all.

Gitpod is intended for previewing the app only, and is _not suitable for use in actual production environments_.

### 2. Installing to a PC

#### System requirements

This application can be installed on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Before installing,
you should have the following software set up and running:

* A webserver (Apache, IIS, nginx, ... etc)
* PHP 5.6 or higher.
* MySQL 5.6 and above; or MariaDB 10 and above.

If you don't have the above software installed, we recommend installing
[Xampp latest version](https://www.apachefriends.org/).

#### Installation steps

1. [Download the latest release as a zip file](https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-inventory-manager/releases/latest).
(Click the *Source code (zip)* link down the page).

2. Extract the contents of the zip file. Then copy the contents of the `app` folder into a folder inside your document root.
For Xampp on Windows, this is usually `C:\xampp\htdocs`
(*[more info about how to find your 'document root'](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/help/z/Document_Root.html)*).

3. In your web browser, go to: `http://localhost/app-folder/`
(change `app-folder` to the name of the folder inside your document root where you extracted the zip in step 2).

4. You should now see the setup wizard in your browser. Just follow the steps!

### 3. Installing to a web/intranet server

#### System requirements

* PHP 5.6 or higher
* MySQL 5.6 and above; or MariaDB 10 and above.
	
Make sure your have access to a MySQL/MariaDB database.
You might need to set up one in your server control panel.
Please refer to your server documentation or the technical support staff for help on this if needed.

If your server has cPanel installed, here is a
[screencast explaining how to install your application using cPanel](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/how-to-upload-your-appgini-web-application-to-a-web-server-using-ftp-and-cpanel).

#### Installation steps

1. [Download the latest release as a zip file](https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-inventory-manager/releases/latest).

2. Extract the contents of the zip file. Then upload the contents of the `app` folder to a folder inside your server document root.
This might be a folder named `public_html` or `/var/www/html` or something else, based on how your server is set up
(ask your server admin if you need help on that).

3. In your web browser, visit `http://server.com/app-folder/`
(change `server.com` above to the actual domain name or IP address of your server,
and change `app-folder` to the name of the folder inside your document root where
you uploaded the files in step 2).

## Customization

This application was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini). This means you can easily customize it by
opening the included AXP project file in AppGini. Examples of possible customization you can do from there include:

* [Changing the application theme](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/how-to-easily-change-your-appgini-application-theme).
* Adding more fields to existing tables, or entirely new tables to fit your use cases.
* Changing the options/behavior of any table/field in your application.
* For more details, check [the AppGini tutorials](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/).

You can also perform more advanced customization, like adding reports,
changing validation rules, adding business logic, ... etc. through hooks.
Please refer to the [AppGini hooks documentation](https://bigprof.com/appgini/help/advanced-topics/hooks)
for more details.
